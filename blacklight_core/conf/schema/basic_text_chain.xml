<!--
     - ICUNormalizer2CharFilterFactory does nkfc normalization (ICU Normalizer2)
     - MappingCharFilterFactory does char-level expansion, (for example, flats and sharps)
     - ICUTokenizer does a smarter job of finding work boundaries
     - KeywordRepeatFilterFactory indexes stemmed words twice, once as stemmed and once as given,
       giving additional relevancy to the latter if it matches
     - SynonymFilterFactory for synonyms at the token level
     - CJK* does magical CJK stuff that I don't really understand
     - The stemmer stems with whatever class is provided (e.g., KStemFilterFactory)
     - DecimalDigitFilterFactory folds decimals (0..9) into their latin equivalents
     - RemoveDuplicates does what it says, esp. important because we'll end up wtih two identical
       tokens for everything that isn't stemmed (due to the )

     - With the ICUFolding, we get:
       + NFKC normalization (precomosing),
       + Unicode case folding (i.e., lowercasing)
       + search term folding (removing accents, etc).
     - Synonyms can be put in &synonym_file; (see sample synonyms.txt file in solr example)
     - The CJK stuff produces bigrams for those languages
     - The KeywordRepeat removes duplicate terms at the same token position
