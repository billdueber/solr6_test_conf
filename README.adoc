= Bill Dueber's DynamicField Solr Config

== The goals

I started this looking for a configuration that was flexible and resulting in
solr documents that made sense to me. I ended up with the following goals:

- every field is *either* stored or indexed -- never both.
- indexed fields reflect their type in the name
- stored fields are either a bare word ('main_author') or a 
  bare word with a `_a` indicating it's multivalued (an *array*)
- a single field can result in multiple indexed fields

This results in nice clean stored values (either _field_ or _field_a_), and takes advantage
of the fieldTypes described at the bottom of this document.

== Using the dynamic field definitions

A constructed field name has two to four parts, separated by underscores.

- The _basename_. This is the descriptive field name (title, author, etc.)
- The _fieldtype suffix_.  There is a mapping of fieldtype suffixes to fieldtypes
  in the `generate_dfields.rb` script. Some map to multiple indexed types, and
  adding to that list is as easy as editing the top of the file.
- An optional `_stored` (that literal string), indicating that the item should
  be stored.
- An optional `_single` (again that exact string) indicating that this is a single-valued
  field instead of a multi-valued field.
  
If `_stored` and `_single` are both present, they need to be in that order. 

=== Examples

title_t_stored::
  Will create both stored and indexed fields, multivalued because we didn't specify `_single`
  - `title_t`, an indexed `text` field
  - `title_a`, a multivalued stored field ('a' for _array_, since this is a multi-valued field)
  
mainauthor_ef_stored_single::
  - `mainauthor_e`, an indexed `exactish` field
  - `mainauthor_f`, an indexed string suitable for _faceting_
  - `mainauthor`, the stored, single-valued field.
  
fulltext_t::
  - `fulltext_t`, just the single indexed, multivalued field with no stored field.
  
fulltext_t_single::
  - `fulltext_t`, again the indexed field with no stored field, but this one will complain
     if you try to send multiple values.

`rawmarc`:: 
  - Just the single-valued string field `rawmarc`
  
`emoji_a`::
  - A single multi-valued string field called `emoji_a`

=== Fields meant for sorting

Two fieldname suffixes are special-cased: _ssort_ for strings meant as a sort key, and
_isort_ for integers (longs, actually, under the hood) meant as a sort key. The idea
is that you don't have to separately store a sort field as, say, `title_sort_str` just
so you can see what it is when debugging.

Examples:

  - `title_ssort` will just produce the string field `title_ssort`; no changes
  - `title_ssort_stored` will produce `title_ssort`, but also a stored string called
    `title_sort` (note _sort_ instead of _ssort_)
  - Similarly, `age_isort_stored` will produce both `age_isort` (indexed long) and 
    `age_sort` (stored string)

=== A couple quick notes
    
 - Anything that doesn't match a dynamic field is going to end up as a single-valued
   stored, unindexed string. In particular, folks that like to use `whatever_display` 
   for display text can still do so.
 - Anything that ends is `_a` will end up as a set of multivalued, stored, unindexed strings.


=== Known limitations of the dynamic fields

  - All indexed types are multivalued under the hood. This means that if you define two fields:
    ** `fulltext_tsearch_single`
    ** `fulltext_t_single`

...then you'll have overloaded `fulltext_t` and it will end up with multiple values if you send
data for both `fulltet_tsearch_single` and `fulltet_t_single`, even though both individual fields are
single-valued. There's no good solution except to be aware of what indexed fields you're actually producing

 - There's no good way to know what's actually been indexed. This is a limitation of dynamic fields in 
   general, but my schema exacerbates the problem because there's not a one-to-one mapping
   between the field name sent to solr (`title_t_stored_single`) and the actual fields solr has
   (`title_t` and `title_a` in this case)


=== Why this works

I take advantage of a couple peculiarities of solr:

- There's no penalty (that I can find, anyway) for having a stored, unindexed
  field and an unstored, indexed field as opposed to a single field
  that is both stored and indexed
- Dynamic fields can be totally ignored (neither indexed nor stored)
  but still be available for copyFields
- Searching a multi-valued field with one value is no different than searching a
  single-valued field. This allows me to "reuse" indexed field types
  while allowing the field name actually passed to be used as a gatekeeper
  for non-multi fields (e.g., if you send multiple values to a single-valued
  field, it'll still blow up real nice).

== Field types

There are several field type definitions in the [`conf/schema`](https://github.com/billdueber/solr6_test_conf/tree/master/test_core/conf/schema) directory that 
might have some advantages over the stock Solr types. Some highlights:

Pre-tokenization manipulation:: Some common and/or important text strings are hard
to search on, like _&_, C++_ and _Aâ™®_. The [common text chain](https://github.com/billdueber/solr6_test_conf/blob/master/test_core/conf/schema/basic_text_chain.xml) I use does reasonably substitutions 
of these before tokenization, so you can muck with punctuation terms before throwing them out. I also take that opporntunity to do unicode normalization.

text::  A basic analyzed text type, built for unicode support (for those of us that have to deal with
many languages) and using unicode folding (lowercasing), normalization, and the ICU tokenizer. Forms the basis of all `text_leftjustified` and `exactish`

text_leftjustified:: The `text_leftjustified` type will only match a phrase query
at the start of a string.

exactish:: A replacement of sorts for the String type, for exact matching without
taking into account case or most punctuation.

numericID:: A relatively specialized type that allows you to extract numeric strings
from text, demanding that they be of a certain length (or length range). Currently set up, essentially, for ISSN extraction, but can be adapted for any data where the numeric ID you're looking for might be buried in other text.

Special library types:: ...for us library-types. This repo includes a .jar file and fieldTypes that
do normalization on ISBNs and LCCNs, so you know index-time and query-time changes are 
equivalent.
