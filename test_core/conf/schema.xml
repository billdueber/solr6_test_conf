 This is the Solr schema file. This file should be named "schema.xml" and
 should be in the conf directory under the solr home
 (i.e. ./solr/conf/schema.xml by default) 
 or located where the classloader for the Solr webapp can find it.

 This example schema is the recommended starting point for users.
 It should be kept correct and concise, usable out-of-the-box.

<schema name="dueber_blacklight_marc_solr" version="0.1">
  <!-- attribute "name" is the name of this schema and is only used for display purposes.
       version="x.y" is Solr's version number for the schema syntax and 
       semantics.  It should not normally be changed by applications.

       1.0: multiValued attribute did not exist, all fields are multiValued 
            by nature
       1.1: multiValued attribute introduced, false by default 
       1.2: omitTermFreqAndPositions attribute introduced, true by default 
            except for text fields.
       1.3: removed optional field compress feature
       1.4: autoGeneratePhraseQueries attribute introduced to drive QueryParser
            behavior when a single string produces multiple tokens.  Defaults 
            to off for version >= 1.4
       1.5: omitNorms defaults to true for primitive field types 
            (int, float, boolean, string...)
       1.6: useDocValuesAsStored defaults to true.

   <!-- Valid attributes for fields:
     name: mandatory - the name for the field
     type: mandatory - the name of a field type from the 
       <types> fieldType section
     indexed: true if this field should be indexed (searchable or sortable)
     stored: true if this field should be retrievable
     docValues: true if this field should have doc values. Doc values are
       useful for faceting, grouping, sorting and function queries. Although not
       required, doc values will make the index faster to load, more
       NRT-friendly and more memory-efficient. They however come with some
       limitations: they are currently only supported by StrField, UUIDField
       and all Trie*Fields, and depending on the field type, they might
       require the field to be single-valued, be required or have a default
       value (check the documentation of the field type you're interested in
       for more information)
     multiValued: true if this field may contain multiple values per document
     omitNorms: (expert) set to true to omit the norms associated with
       this field (this disables length normalization and index-time
       boosting for the field, and saves some memory).  Only full-text
       fields or fields that need an index-time boost need norms.
       Norms are omitted for primitive (non-analyzed) types by default.
     termVectors: [false] set to true to store the term vector for a
       given field.
       When using MoreLikeThis, fields used for similarity should be
       stored for best performance.
     termPositions: Store position information with the term vector.  
       This will increase storage costs.
     termOffsets: Store offset information with the term vector. This 
       will increase storage costs.
     required: The field is required.  It will throw an error if the
       value does not exist
     default: a value that should be used if no value is specified
       when adding a document.

   <!-- field names should consist of alphanumeric or underscore characters only and
      not start with a digit.  This is not currently strictly enforced,
      but other field names will not have first class support from all components
      and back compatibility is not guaranteed.  Names with both leading and
      trailing underscores (e.g. _version_) are reserved.
   -->

   <!-- If you remove this field, you must _also_ disable the update log in solrconfig.xml
      or Solr won't start. _version_ and update log are required for SolrCloud

   <!-- points to the root document of a block of nested documents. Required for nested
      document support, may be removed otherwise
   -->
   <field name="_root_" type="string" indexed="true" stored="false" docValues="false" />

   <!-- Only remove the "id" field if you have a very good reason to. While not strictly
     required, it is highly recommended. A <uniqueKey> is present in almost all Solr 
     installations. See the <uniqueKey> declaration below where <uniqueKey> is set to "id".
     Do NOT change the type and apply index-time analysis to the <uniqueKey> as it will likely 
     make routing in SolrCloud and document replacement in general fail. Limited _query_ time
     analysis is possible as long as the indexing process is guaranteed to index the term
     in a compatible way. Any analysis applied to the <uniqueKey> should _not_ produce multiple
     tokens
